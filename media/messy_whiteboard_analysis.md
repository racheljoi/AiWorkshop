This whiteboard image appears to depict a system architecture or design for a software application. Let me break down the key components and concepts I see:

1. Top-left corner lists three main points:
   - Client data
   - User Profile: 4
   - On-boarding process: KYC (Know Your Customer)

2. There's mention of "Cust. can config-bus. rules" which likely means customers can configure business rules.

3. The central part of the diagram shows several interconnected components:
   - A "Workflow/user work" component
   - A "Customer Portal" or interface
   - Something related to "Output Capture"
   - A "Case Mgmt" (Case Management) system

4. There's a large box labeled "Secured Repository" which includes:
   - Multi-tenant
   - Docs (Documents)
   - Instr. (possibly Instructions)

5. On the right side, there are notes about:
   - "Public API"
   - "Keys for API"
   - "Contribute data - no admin"
   - "$ $ for more data"

6. At the bottom right, there are mentions of:
   - "Entitlements"
   - "Validation/Quality"
   - "Business Rules"
   - "Policy (Process + Security)"

7. Other notable terms:
   - "PST-preferred Identifiable info"
   - "Powerful flexible"
   - "Metadata (extensible)"
   - "man-like (matching rules)"
   - "Context Engine"

How it might work:
This seems to be a design for a flexible, multi-tenant system that handles customer data, workflows, and document management. Users can configure business rules and access the system through a customer portal. The secured repository stores documents and data for multiple tenants. There's an API for integration, and the system incorporates entitlements, validation, and business rules. The context engine and metadata features suggest advanced data processing and search capabilities.

The system appears to be designed with security and flexibility in mind, allowing for customization of workflows and rules while maintaining data separation between tenants. The mention of "$ $ for more data" might indicate a tiered pricing model based on data usage.

This whiteboard sketch likely represents a brainstorming or planning session for a complex enterprise software system, possibly in the realm of document management, customer relationship management, or business process automation.
