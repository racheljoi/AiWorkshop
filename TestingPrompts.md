>- choose something from [this heuristics book](http://dojo-static.ministryoftesting.com/downloads/60PowerfulHeuristicseBook.pdf) (listed out below)
>- continue to refine and play in this space
>- see if you can get test ideas in a nicer format
>- give it some examples - does that change anything?
>- ask it to check its work before giving you answers
